Hi, Im Jovon ðŸ‘‹

I am a music producer, entrepreneur, and Full-Stack web developer. 
I enjoy working on creative projects and  applying web development and tech skills to my passions and personal businesses.

I am currently working on:
Flip it! (A music library created by users that allows them to remix and sample each other's music )
DA$goodmusic (A small international music label founded by myself and John Pope)
